```{r example}
## load the package
library(foghorn)
```

`foghorn` provides a graphical summary for CRAN check results for the packages
maintained by individuals (the number is parentheses indicates the number of R
flavors used by CRAN that generate notes, warnings, errors):

```{r graphical-interface}
## Graphical interface
summary_cran_results(email = "francois.michonneau@gmail.com")
```

The information can also be summarized as a table:

```{r tibble}
## Summary as a tibble
check_cran_results(email = "francois.michonneau@gmail.com")
```

In addition of your own packages, you can also check the results for other
packages that might be of interest to you:

```{r package-name}
## either by themselves
summary_cran_results(pkg = c("ggplot2", "dplyr"))
check_cran_results(pkg = c("ggplot2", "dplyr"))

## or by combining them with email addresses
summary_cran_results(email = "francois.michonneau@gmail.com",
                     pkg = c("mregions", "ridigbio"))
check_cran_results(email = "francois.michonneau@gmail.com",
                   pkg = c("mregions", "ridigbio"))
```

You can also inspect the logs for the check results using
`show_cran_results(pkg)`, while `visit_cran_check(pkg)` takes you to the CRAN
webpage.

```{r show-cran-results}
show_cran_results(pkg = "tidyr")
```

## Where does it get the data?

The data from the CRAN check results used by this package are either scrapped
from the CRAN web pages (default), or are from the CRAN database. The first
option is faster if you want to check regularly a few packages. However, if you
are doing statistics on a large number of packages, using the CRAN database is
recommended. To use the CRAN database, add `src = "crandb"` in your function
calls:

```{r show-cran-db}
check_cran_results(pkg = "nlme", src = "crandb")
```
